# nimi pi toki pona

kama pona

----

This is a dictionary for the constructed language toki pona. It looks up the definition for the word in your clipboard. You can also type a word manually if you'd like.

It's windows only at the moment, but it should build on OSX and Linux with the right versions of SDL and GLEW.

## dictionaries

It looks for a "dictionary.json" file in the same folder as the exe. I have included a dictionary parsed from jan Lope's [Toki_Pona_Lessons_English](https://github.com/jan-Lope/Toki_Pona_lessons_English).

The structure of the dictionary should be clear from the file.

## building

Use [premake 5](https://premake.github.io/) to generate build projects. Only tested with vs2017.
